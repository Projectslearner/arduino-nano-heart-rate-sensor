### Heart Rate Sensor

#### Project Overview

The Heart Rate Sensor project demonstrates how to use an Arduino Nano to read and display data from a heart rate sensor. This project is ideal for applications in health monitoring, fitness tracking, and educational purposes.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **Heart Rate Sensor**
3. **Breadboard and Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Heart Rate Sensor to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect the Vcc pin of the heart rate sensor to the 5V pin on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the GND pin of the heart rate sensor to the GND pin on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the output pin of the heart rate sensor to analog pin A0 on the Arduino Nano.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the heart rate sensor to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Connect the Arduino Nano to your computer using a USB cable.
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Select the appropriate board (Arduino Nano) and port from the Tools menu.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, place the heart rate sensor on your fingertip or earlobe.
   - Observe the sensor values printed on the Serial Monitor.

#### Applications

- **Health Monitoring:** Measure and monitor heart rate for health purposes.
- **Fitness Tracking:** Use heart rate data to track exercise intensity and performance.
- **Educational Purposes:** Demonstrate how biosensors work and how to interface them with microcontrollers.

#### Notes

- Ensure the correct orientation and connection of the heart rate sensor to prevent damage.
- Experiment with different placements of the sensor for optimal readings.
- The sensor value can be further processed to calculate the actual heart rate in beats per minute (BPM).
